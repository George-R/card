        <p>Hi Sabrina,</p>
        <p>So I realized I did not buy you a birthday card :( so instead I decided to program one quickly for you!!( </p>
        <p>I wish I was there with you today more than anything. I want to promise you that I am never going to miss your birthday like this ever again.</p>
        <p>You mean the world to me, and no matter where I am or what I do, I can always feel the love I have for you. Sometimes I still can't believe how lucky I am to call you my girlfriend.
          I love you, and I hope I can help make your 20's the best years of your life.
        </p>
        <p>Love you forever,

        </p>
